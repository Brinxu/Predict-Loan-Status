# Predict Loan Status 

## Project Motivation 

Based on the Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), a loan data from Prosper is used to study key factors that predict loan Status. Specifically, I asked the following three questions:

- How do homeownership and employment status predict Loan amount?
- How do homeownership and employment status predict borrowersâ€™ APR?
- How does Loan Status vary by homeownership status and employment status?

## File Description

- A Descriptive Jupyter Notebook
- A README file

## Installation 

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

No additional installations beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Analysis Results 

Key results and findings were listed below. Find more on [Medium](https://medium.com/@brinxu1/predict-loan-status-9784e36a5736)
- For those with a home, I found that borrows' APR is the lowest for full-time employed. 
- For those without a home, it is one of the highest for those who do not have a home.
- Putting together, it looks like those who are full-time employed and have a home enjoy the highest loan amount as well we the lowest borrower APR.
